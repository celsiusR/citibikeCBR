## Overview

Citi Bike is the nation's largest bike share program, with 25,000 bikes and over 1,500 stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Jersey City and Hoboken.

The analysis provides data of:

- How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
- A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

## Results

### From the analysis the visualization August Peak Hours

- Highest activity hours are from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM and require the most resources mobilized.
- The activity from 2:00 AM to 5:00 AM is low so this would be the window for bike maintenance.

-  Male users are three times more likely to ride the bike as compared to female riders.

- Bikes are checked out after approximately 60 minutes of use and remain checked out for 4  to 6 hours. Not shown in the graph is the selection of "All" in the filter which if clicked shows 4 to 6 hours.

## Summary 

The data shows high activity of the bike sharing service in New York during the month of August 2019.
The far majority of the rides were in the island of Manhattan, by male users during the morning hours and evening hours corresponding to the rush times. Data shows  Citi Bike services are currently being used as an alternative to public transportation by workers for their commute.

Additional analysis with correlating:

- Data from different months to determine trends across the year could provide a more fine grained analysis
- including weather data to find the correlation between the weather and the rides would definitely provide additional points for analysis
